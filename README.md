# Outdated

This repository is outdated and not up-to-date with recent Kibana versions anymore.

You can find replacing sample plugins within the Kibana repository, now, which are automatically 
tested against Kibana, and thus up-to-date. Make sure to select the appropriate version/branch 
you're developing against.
